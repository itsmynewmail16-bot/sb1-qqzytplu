# 🔍 FindIt — Smart Lost & Found for the Community

## 📌 Overview
FindIt is a modern, intuitive lost-and-found web app that connects people who’ve lost something with those who’ve found it.  
Instead of relying on chance encounters or scattered social media posts, FindIt provides a **central hub** for reporting, discovering, and claiming items — all with built-in safeguards to prevent false claims.
